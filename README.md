🐱 Cat Facts & Images App

This project is a React application built with Vite that displays random cat facts along with dynamically generated cat images. Each time a new fact is fetched, the app extracts the first three words of the fact and uses them as text overlaid on a cat image provided by the Cataas API.

The project demonstrates the use of custom React hooks, state management with useState, and side effects with useEffect to handle asynchronous data fetching and UI updates. It also shows how to work with external APIs, encode URL parameters safely, and structure reusable logic in a clean and maintainable way.

This application is a simple but practical example of combining multiple APIs, handling asynchronous workflows, and building interactive user interfaces with modern React.
